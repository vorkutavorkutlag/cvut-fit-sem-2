The official definition for a subspace is a subset that is a vector space with the same operations as its parent vector space.

Zero matrix is not invertible as $AB= BA = I_n$ is never satisfied.

The definition of a finite and infinite dimensional vector space is having (and respectively, not having) a (finite) list that spans it.
